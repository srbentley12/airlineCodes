###Android app - Flashcards for studying aiport codes

I developed this as requested with a very simple UI. Airports that service Alaska Airlines are already preloaded into an array.
The array is shuffled and the user simply taps the screen to switch to the answer and next flashcard. The text is read aloud to facilitate
multitasking.
